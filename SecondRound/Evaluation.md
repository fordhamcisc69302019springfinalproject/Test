# Parameter We Need
- mean_squared_error (MSE)
- R2_score
- Learning Curve
- Validation Curve
- Confusion Matrix

## Logistic Regression
The evaluation on different parameters.
### Penalty
The default option is 'L2', which works well on most problems. 
However, our model shows a terrible result on L2. 
Therefore, we decide to use L1.

### Solver
- liblinear
- lbfgs
- newton-cg
- sag

### Multi-class

### c

## Random Forest
### n_estimators
The number of trees in the forest.

### oob_score

### criterion

### max_features

### max_depth

### min_samples_split

### min_weight_fraction_leaf

### max_leaf_nodes

### min_impurity_split
