# # User Guidance
## What this part will do
Based on the preprocessing and model repositories, codes on this repository will focus on test the result and performance of our model.
## Algorithms
### Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA
- LDA
### Feature Selection
- Embedded
- Filter
## Test Result and Evaluation 
### Evaluation method
- Lift Graph
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Cross Validation
### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Average Per-class Accuracy
- Log-loss
- Precision-recall
- AUC
- ROC
- Confusion Matrix
## Improvement

# README
## Dataset
The pre processing method is called from the Preprocessing repository.
The raw data looks like this:

## Workflow
After the preprocessing and modeling for the first round, itâ€™s my duty to evaluate the performance of different model. This part would be done in the following orders:
- Feature Correlation 
- Feature Importance Evaluation
- Feature Selection
- Parameter Adjustment
- Model Adjustment
